  		<p>Hello! Welcome to my website.</p> 
  		<p>My name is Monica Schneider. I am a photographer based in the DC area. I enjoy photography, theater, lifting heavy things, reading, and taking risks to get the best possible picture. </p>

		<p>I exclusively shoot my photos using black and white film and a fully manual camera. This gives my work a retro, timeless, and more intimate feel that cannot be replicated with digital equipment or filters. </p>

		<p>Please enjoy exploring the site. If you have questions or are interested in a private photo session do not hesitate to email me and ask.
