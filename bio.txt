Hello! Welcome to my website. A little about me. My name is Monica Schneider. I am a photographer based in the DC area. I enjoy photography, theater, lifting heavy things, reading, and taking risks to get the best possible picture. 

I exclusively shoot my photos using black and white film and a fully manual camera. This gives my work a retro, timeless, and more intimate feel that cannot be replicated with digital equipment or filters. 

Please enjoy exploring the site. If you have questions or are interested in a private photo session do not hesitate to email me and ask.
